This group is working on recreating this [tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/variant-analysis/tutorials/tb-variant-analysis/tutorial.html)

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. According to the WHO, in 2018 there were 10.0 million new cases of TB worldwide and 1.4 million deaths due to the disease, making TB the worldâ€™s most deadly infectious disease. The publication of the genome of M. tuberculosis H37Rv in 1998 gave researchers a powerful new tool in understanding this pathogen. This genome has been revised since then, with the latest version being available as RefSeq entry NC_000962.3. The genome comprises a single circular chromosome of some 4.4 megabases. The H37Rv strain that the genome was sequenced from is a long-preserved laboratory strain, originally isolated from a patient in 1905 and named as H37Rv in 1935. It is notably different in some genomic regions from some modern clinical strains but remains the standard reference sequence for M. tuberculosis (Mtb). In a larger context M. tuberculosis is a prominent member of the Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Complex (MTBC).

This group of related species comprises of the 8 lineages of human-infecting M. tuberculosis as well as predominantly animal-infecting species such as M. bovis and M. pinnipedii. Two other close relatives of Mtb, M. leprae and M. lepromatosis circulate between humans, causing the disease leprosy. Finally amongst the Mycobacteria there are several other species that live in the environment and can cause human disease. These are the Nontuberculous Mycobacteria.

Variation in the genome of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) is associated with changes in phenotype, for example drug resistance and virulence. It is also useful for outbreak investigation as the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a sample can be used to build a phylogeny.

This tutorial will focus on identifying genomic variation in Mtb and using that to explore drug resistance and other aspects of the bacteria.
